# 🚀 Rust Basics for Beginners

Welcome to your Rust journey! This guide walks you through the core concepts of Rust using simple, real-life code examples. Ideal for those just starting out, we'll explore `struct`, `enum`, and `match` in a hands-on way.

## 📦 Structs: Grouping Related Data

A `struct` lets you group related values into one custom type. Here's a basic example:

```rust
struct Car {
    brand: String,
    year: u32,
}

impl Car {
    fn honk(&self) {
        println!("{} says Beep Beep!", self.brand);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_car = Car {
        brand: String::from("Toyota"),
        year: 2020,
    };

    println!("My car is a {} made in {}", my_car.brand, my_car.year);
    my_car.honk();
}
```

### ✅ Output:
```
My car is a Toyota made in 2020
Toyota says Beep Beep!
```

## 🔁 Enums: Choosing One Variant from Many

Enums are useful when a value can be one of a few different kinds:

```rust
enum Coin {
    Penny,
    Nickel,
    Dime,
    Quarter,
}

fn value_in_cents(coin: Coin) -> u8 {
    match coin {
        Coin::Penny => 1,
        Coin::Nickel => 5,
        Coin::Dime => 10,
        Coin::Quarter => 25,
    }
}

fn main() {
    let coin = Coin::Dime;
    println!("The coin is worth {} cents.", value_in_cents(coin));

    let another = Coin::Quarter;
    println!("Another coin is worth {} cents.", value_in_cents(another));
}
```

### ✅ Output:
```
The coin is worth 10 cents.
Another coin is worth 25 cents.
```

## 💡 Recap

- `struct` is for grouping related data.
- `enum` is for defining a type that can be one of many forms.
- `match` is used to compare values and take actions.

You're now on your way to mastering Rust step by step. Keep practicing!
